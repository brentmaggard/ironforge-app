    â””â”€â”€ providers/     # UI state providers (future)
```

**Repository Pattern**:
- `LocalDataSource` (Drift) for offline functionality
- `RemoteDataSource` (Supabase) for future sync capabilities
- Abstract repository interfaces in domain layer
- Concrete implementations in data layer

This allows seamless transition from offline-only to sync-enabled app.

**State Management**:
- Riverpod for dependency injection and state management
- Provider-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Error handling with custom Failure classes
