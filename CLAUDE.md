## Architecture Details

**Current Structure**:
```

    â””â”€â”€ providers/     # UI state providers (future)
```

**Repository Pattern**:
- `LocalDataSource` (Drift) for offline functionality
- `RemoteDataSource` (Supabase) for future sync capabilities
- Abstract repository interfaces in domain layer
- Concrete implementations in data layer

This allows seamless transition from offline-only to sync-enabled app.

**State Management**:
- Riverpod for dependency injection and state management
- Provider-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Error handling with custom Failure classes

## Program Builder System Implementation

### **Design Philosophy**
The Program Builder System follows proven methodologies from successful strength training programs like Starting Strength, StrongLifts 5x5, and 5/3/1. Instead of random workouts, users follow structured programs with built-in progression logic.

### **Key Features**
1. **Program Template Library** - Curated starter programs for different goals
2. **Custom Program Creator** - Visual builder for personalized programs  
3. **Smart Progression** - Auto-calculate weights and track advancement
4. **Program Execution** - Generate workouts from program definitions
5. **Progress Tracking** - Monitor program completion and performance

### **Database Schema (Schema v5)**

```sql
-- Program templates and definitions
CREATE TABLE programs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  author TEXT,
  difficulty TEXT CHECK (difficulty IN ('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced')),
  frequency INTEGER, -- days per week
  duration_weeks INTEGER,
  tags JSON, -- ["strength", "powerlifting", "full-body"]
  config JSON, -- Full program definition
  is_template BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL
);

-- User program instances and progress
CREATE TABLE user_programs (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  program_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  current_week INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  current_day INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('active', 'completed', 'paused')) DEFAULT 'active',
  customizations JSON, -- User modifications
  created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (program_id) REFERENCES programs(id)
);

-- Program workout progression tracking
CREATE TABLE program_sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_program_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  week_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  day_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  workout_id TEXT, -- References workouts table when completed
  scheduled_date DATE,
  completed_at DATETIME,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('scheduled', 'completed', 'skipped')) DEFAULT 'scheduled',
  notes TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_program_id) REFERENCES user_programs(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (workout_id) REFERENCES workouts(id)
);
```

### **Program Configuration Model**

Programs are defined using JSON configuration that specifies:
- **Workout Structure**: Exercises, sets, reps, weights
- **Progression Rules**: Linear (+5lbs), percentage-based (% of 1RM)
- **Scheduling**: Weekly patterns, rest days, deload weeks
- **Failure Handling**: Deload protocols, form checks

**Example Basic Beginner Program:**
```json
{
  "name": "Basic Beginner Routine",
  "description": "3-month linear progression program for complete beginners",
  "frequency": 3,
  "duration_weeks": 12,
  "workouts": {
    "A": {
      "name": "Workout A",
      "exercises": [
        {
          "exerciseId": "bent_over_row",
          "sets": [
            {"reps": 5, "weight": 95, "type": "normal"},
            {"reps": 5, "weight": 95, "type": "normal"},
            {"reps": "5+", "weight": 95, "type": "amrap"}
          ],
          "restTime": 180,
          "progression": {
            "type": "linear",
            "increment": 2.5,
            "unit": "lbs"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "B": {
      "name": "Workout B", 
      "exercises": [...]
    }
  },
  "schedule": ["A", "B", "A", "rest", "B", "A", "B"],
  "progressionRules": {
    "failureThreshold": 3,
    "deloadPercentage": 10,
    "successCriteria": "complete_all_sets"
  }
}
```
